# React-Portfolio

This repository details the progression of my personal portfolio built with a React Front-End. I have compiled 6 total projects from the University of Washington Full Stack Development Bootcamp along with direct links to my Github portfolio and LinkedIn page. I've listed a number of technical skills from the course and looking forward to adding more! By creating this portfolio, I will be setting myself apart from other developers whose portfolios are not up to date with the latest technologies.

<h1>Overview:</h1>
When you initialize a React application, all of the Front-End starter code is produced for you. This simplified the overall architecture of the application because I could store all my components in one directory. For testing purposes, the React application updates as you make changes which made styling very easy for the React Portfolio.

<h1>Technologies Used:</h1>
<li>React Documentation - (https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)</li>
<li>Material.io Documentation - (https://material.io/)</li>
<li>NPM React-Social-Icons Documentation - (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons)</li>

<h1>Setup Before Deployment:</h1>
<li>Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"</li>
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "npm run start"</li>
<li>Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "Compiled successfully! Local: http://localhost:3000"</li>
<li>In your browser, type "http://localhost:3000/"(if tab does not open automatically from running the command line prompt)</li>

<h1>Future Development:</h1>
If I were to continue developing my portfolio further I would focus on tailoring the layout and presentation towards a potential employer and what they are looking for in a qualified candidate. If the position I'm applying for is a front-end role, I would want to showcase my front-end abilities and pivot away from the back-end technologies.

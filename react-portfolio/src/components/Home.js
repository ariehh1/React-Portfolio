        I am currently taking the UW Coding Certification for a new challenge
        and opportunity to expand my skillset. I've always felt that I had a
        technical aptitude and mindset towards solving complex problems so
        transitioning into the software development field was right for me. Up
        to this point, I have learned quite a bit of new material and looking
        forward to continue down this path! After completing my Coding
        Certification, I will be looking forward to surveying the software
        development job market. A few position titles I'm considering upon
        graduation include "Business Analyst, Customer Success Analyst, and Data
        Operations". I'm also interested in learning more about the storage
        functionalities of large tech companies and how their code structure
        layers in security measures.
